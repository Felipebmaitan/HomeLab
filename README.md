# Compose Files for my personal server.

Here are the docker compose files with the configuration. Tested and working on Debian 13.

All the files were made by me (with the help of a LOT of LLM prompts, lol). As I'm just a tech enthusiast managing a server for the first time, this is not by any means a holy grail for security/performance and may probably be full of bugs and security issues. I'll probably try to fix them as I continue to manage the server, but I don't guarantee anything.

If you happen to be a docker pro and see some possible improvements, feel free to open a PR =)

## Important

If it is your first time running the containers, run setup.sh to create all necessary folders and copy the nginx.conf to the appropriate location.
